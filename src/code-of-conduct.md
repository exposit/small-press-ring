# Code of Conduct

To qualify to join this ring, you need to have a page showcasing your small rpg press, whether that's focused on table-top role-playing games or rpg-adjacent fiction. This is <em>incredibly</em> loose; one pwyw product or a clear intent to publish one qualifies you! 

You also need to include the "next" and "previous" buttons provided on the main page, at the bare minimum, on your press page. Ie, keep it a ring! Styling, attribution, and associated text and images are entirely up to you. Please place the linking code in a visible, easy to find spot (for example, mine's next to my blog's search widget).

# Rules:

<p>1. This is a ring hosted by me, Tam H., out of my github. I am not interested in policing sites for content, maturity, or tone. I am not the internet police, nor am I your mother. I do not need any more stress in my life. I will not be going over anything with a fine-toothed comb. That said...  </p>
<p>2. <strong>Hateful ideologies are not welcome.</strong> This includes harassment and discrimination, particularly on the basis of race, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, or physical or mental ability. Please don't sign up if this applies to your site or if this rule offends you.</p>
<p>3. I reserve the right to remove anything necessary at any time, or when I get around to it, in order to keep things tidy, to keep up with the purpose of this ring, and to uphold rules 1 and 2. You have the right to leave this ring at any time without fuss; just delete the code snippet from your site and let me know via the form or in the repo (or wait and when I notice I'll remove it). </p>
